Gish
====

Gish is a side-scrolling platformer video game with some physics puzzle elements developed by Cryptic Sea (pseudonym of Alex Austin), Edmund McMillen, Josiah Pisciotta and published by Chronic Logic in 2004. The game was featured in the first Humble Indie Bundle in May 2010. Following the success of the Humble Bundle promotion, Cryptic Sea pledged to go open source with the game which eventually happened under the GPLv2 on May 29, 2010. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_(video_game)).

This is port of the Gish game to PSVita which uses SDL2, PVR_PSP2, OpenAL and Ogg Vorbis libraries.
